                <p>1. The demographics for this website is targeted for a world wide audience. So many people of different nationalities and economic standpoints visit this site it has to be as generic and easy to use as possible. It has to be simple enough a Sunday School teacher in Ecuador can find his material but powerful enough for General Authorities to fulfil their demanding calling.</p>
                <p>2. The site meets the needs of millions of members and non-members of the Church to find uplifting and spiritualing fulfilling material. It was created to be the ultimate source to everything LDS, from everything like paying tithing to commonly asked questions about the faith.</p>
                <p>3. The most popular search topics and pressing articles are shown on the front page. It is updated frequently so users will always find current updated content. The search bar is right on the front for quick navigation to something you know you are looking for. And then there is the subtly 3 bar options button of to the left for more experienced navigation of the full capacity of the site.</p>
               <p>4. What made using the site enjoyable is that it was very well optimized for my size of screen. It felt almost as fluid as using an application. Even for reading my scriptures on there instead of in the app went well with no kinks. Overall, I think what made it not painful to use was all the consideration they took into making navigation intuitive.</p>
               <p>5. The site facilitated mobile users very well. I was astounded at the ability of the site to quickly adjust to the screen size and type of interaction smartphones have. All the graphics were adjusted slightly to look more user friendly on a mobile device.</p>

                <p>Description:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Name: Victor Hernandez</li>

                <h2>Site Contrast</h2>
                <a href="https://lds.org" title="View lds.org">lds.org</a> Versus <a href="https://supercrosslive.com">supercrosslive.com</a>
                <p>1. Supercross live knew exactly who their target audience was, people who enjoy watching supercross and want to know more information about it. They had pictures of bikes everywhere and a million links to go see a million other supercross things. This was not their problem.</p>
                <p>2. They met the needs of their audience because I came on to their website to check when the next race would be and I was on their website for an hour. I was highly entertained by their content.</p>
                <p>3. Organization was their weakness. Their website was awful at trying to find anything in specific. The videos were unable to be played in fullscreen mode because they wanted you to see the video with the border they put around the video playback square. You really felt forced to view certain articles and felt like someone was taking your hand through the whole website and telling you where to go. I did not enjoy this at all. While lds.org gave me many different options to find my content easily, supercrosslive.com felt more like a facebook type scroller for content that did not need to be accessed that way.</p>
                <p>4. The site tried to facilitate a mobile enviroment, but it wasn't enough. As you scrolled you could see everything resizing for your screen and felt very laggy as well as unresponsive. </p>
