        <h1>Purpose Statement</h1>
        <p>I am planning a weather site web project for my CIT 230 Web - Frontend class. The puropse of this site will be to provide accurate weather reports for whatever location the user desires in a user friendly way. It will help me learn the principles of web design we have learned thus far and I will be continuing to learn new skills to improve the site. This site represents the site in its current planned state.</p>
