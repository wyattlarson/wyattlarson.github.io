        <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
        <p>I am planning a weather site web project for my CIT 230 Web - Frontend class. The puropse of this site will be to provide accurate weather reports for whatever location the user desires in a user friendly way. It will help me learn the principles of web design we have learned thus far and I will be continuing to learn new skills to improve the site. I plan to create a weather website unlike any other. It won't be covered in flashy banners, auto-playing videos, and pointless news articles that seem to plauge every weather website. It will show exactly what the user came to see, just the weather. It will put the content front and center of what the user actually came to see.</p>

        <section id="audience">
        <h2>Audience Description</h2>
            <p>I am aiming at a pretty specific audience. For my website I am going for a very simple interface that is very plain with limited options. It is for someone who just needs to check the weather very quickly and doesn't want to have to worry about all the bells and whistles getting in the way. The site will only have one primary product, an intuitive and easy way to find the weather forecast for a given location. The desktop site will be very similar as the mobile versions to provide a uniform feel when visiting the site using different devices. Anyone ages 14-60 would have a very satisfying exprience using the site because of its simplicity. It will be easy to quickly look up weather while on the drive to work or while relaxing at home; both on mobile devices. It will quickly answer the question of what the weather is going to be like that day, or even the next ten days if they are interested. The site will typically be visited in the morning hours as people are preparing for their day.</p>

            <p>Steve Bob is a very intelligent man with a busy schedule. So busy in fact that every second he wastes he is losing money. His fiance is trying to get him to slow down with life but his work goals don't allow for that. Steve is primarily a smart phone user. He has a desktop at home which he does not use very much. His mornings are usually pretty rushed, and the first part of the day that he has time to check his phone is on the subway on the way to work. His service is a little spotty down there, but since it is so early, it is as good of a chance as any to check what the weather is going to be like that day. He wants a website that can just tell him the basics of today and not take forever to load with spotty service.<br> Quote: "All I want is a weather service that I can load in a couple seconds that will give me the basic information I need to know, not what hurricane Matthew is doing farther down the east coast."</p>

            <p>"I like where you are going with this. However, I think that the image where most of your data is going to be, should be a text box. Just because it can be manipulated easier with java script when the time comes. I think with a cool background you can make it all look like an image. Also, if you are planning on putting your 10 day forecast in that box in your small screen I might separate it, but if you just are putting that dayâ€™s forecast on that then I think it is great. Overall though I think that it is a good design. It helped me think of ways that I can simplify my own design."
                <br></P>
        <p> I made some modifications to my mobile site according to the suggestions Kiao made, by adding the four bottom buttons I had excluded before. I will attatch an updated version of the wireframe here. I also added more detail to what is going to be in my content box to help us visualize it a bit better. It will be a text based content box mixed with an image. Also when the search button is clicked, suggested cities will be listed (such as the ones that we actually have data for).
